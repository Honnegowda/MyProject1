1.javascript is dynamic and lossley typed scripting language.

2. javascript having 6 datatypes
	a.Number
	b.String
	c.Boolean
	d.undefined
	d.Object
	e.Function
	
3.javascript functional language
    functions are primary citizens(we can treat functions are data)

4.loosley typed
   function add(a, b){}
   we  can invoke function different ways
   add(100, 20
   add('10','20')
   add(function(){},  function(){})
   .
   .
   etc


5. when function  invoked it will pass two  variables implicity]

   this
   arguments

6.this depends on the how function is invoked.

7. a method is attribute in  object with its  value is  type function
    var  emp  = {name:"Honnegowda",
                 WhoAmI:function(){console.log("I'm"  +this.name)}}
    here is WhoAmI is method of  an  object


8.There 6 different  ways to invoke a function  in javascript
   a. as Normalfunction
   b. as method of an object
   c.using call()
   d.using apply()
   e.using new operator(this  will return  default  by constructor  function)


9.arguments in funcction is aray like obejct.


10 immediatley invoking function Expression(IIFE)


11.default value of  function is undefined

12 construtor functions starts with uppercase

13.every object  in javascript have a constructor  property



true, false, truthy and falsy


empty string,  null, undefined, NaN, 0(are the five falsy values in javascript)
other  than  this  five values all are truthy


prototypel  inheritance.


prototype hoping.
prototype hoping for only read


Primitives have the following characteristics:
Compared by value
The “content” is compared:
> 3 === 3
true
> 'abc' === 'abc'
true
Always immutable
Properties can’t be changed, added, or removed:
> var str = 'abc';
> str.length = 1; // try to change property `length`
> str.length
// ⇒ no effect
3
> str.foo = 3; // try to create property `foo`
> str.foo
no effect, unknown property


Objects have the following characteristics:
Compared by reference
Identities are compared; every value has its own identity:
> {} === {}
false
// two different empty objects
> var obj1 = {};
> var obj2 = obj1;
> obj1 === obj2
true
Mutable by default
You can normally freely change, add, and remove properties (see “Single Objects”
on page 25):
> var obj = {};
> obj.foo = 123; // add property `foo`
> obj.foo
123

• undefined means “no value.” 

Uninitialized variables are undefined :
> var foo;
> foo
undefined

Missing parameters are undefined :
> function f(x) { return x }
> f()
undefined

If you read a nonexistent property, you get undefined :
> var obj = {}; // empty object
> obj.foo
undefined

cateagorizing values using typeof and instanceof

typeof mainly used for primitive types
instanceof used for  objects

instanceof looks like this:
value instanceof Constr

It returns true if value is an object that has been created by the constructor Constr (see
“Constructors: Factories for Objects” on page 28). 

Here are some examples:
> var b = new Bar();
> b instanceof Bar
true
// object created by constructor Bar

> {} instanceof Object
true
> [] instanceof Array
true
> [] instanceof Object
true
// Array is a subconstructor of Object

> undefined instanceof Object
false
> null instanceof Object
false

binary Logical operators
 binary logical operators in  javascripts are short circuiting  the  means if first  operand  is  more enough to decide  value its not  going to  evaluate seconde  operand

for  example

 false  && foo()
 if  false  is  more  enough to  get  outcome  so foo  function  not  called  by engine.


And(&&)

if first  operand is falsy  return it otherwise  return second


NaN && 123
'NaN'

123 && 'abc'
'abc'

OR(||)

if  first opernad  is truthy return it other wise return second  operator

variables  are function scoped



angular js


angular js  is  javascript framework
building  blocks of angular js
1. module
   a logical container  of  application component

2. "scope"  obejct
   detects the model changes  and emits  events

3.controller
   a function  where you coordinates user actions  by configuring scope  object.

4.Directive
   connect DOM with scope

5. Filter
   a function used  to transform the data for  presentation

6. Factory

7. Services

8. Value

9. Provider

10. Constant

2, 3, 4, 5 are used encapsulate user  interaction logic

6, 7, 8, 9, 10 encapsulates  non-user interaction logic
